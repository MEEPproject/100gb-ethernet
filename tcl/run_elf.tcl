# script to run bare-metal application via JTAG
# XSCT reference: https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2020_1/vitis_doc/upu1569395223804.html
# XSCT uses Xvfb and thus "ssh -X" should be used for remote run

# ----- Connecting to the board via JTAG, initializing target
# Remote connection case (on remote host with board connected "hw_server -s tcp::3121" should be run with port 3121 enabled in firewall)
# connect -url tcp:192.168.0.14:3121
# Local connection case
connect -url tcp:localhost:3121
# connect
connect -list
